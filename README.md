# Lesson Q&A Part 1

1.) Study the Yourdon [2] concept of a design walkthrough and the IBM concept [1] of a design inspection. Discuss the similarities and the differences between them.

Ans: The IBM concept of a design inspection is a regulated associate gathering audit of a work item, with every progression checked against foreordained criteria. While the Yourdon idea of a design walkthrough is a review where the author drives the team through a manual or simulated execution of the product using predefined situations.

2.) A software engineering group is developing a mission-critical software system that will launch laser-guided missiles to its destinations. This is a new kind of product that was never built by the company. As a quality assurance manager, which code review methodology—walkthrough or inspection—would you recommend? Justify your answer.

Ans: The code review methodology that will fit their situation is the method of walkthrough, since the system they are developing are for laser-guided missiles. With the walkthrough method, they can review the system by simulating it using predefined scenarios. 

3.)  What size of a review team would you recommend for the project in exercise 2, and why? What are the different roles of each member of the review team? What groups should send representatives to participate in code review?

The review team must include software and hardware development staff, customer support group members, system test team members, and the project manager because these team has a specialization in specific task or project has given. It depends on how big is the project. 
 
Ans: The review team must have hardware and software development staff, a team of customer support, framework test colleagues, and a project manager for each specialization. The team size will rely on upon how enormous is the project.


4.) Suppose that the C programming language is chosen in the project in exercise 2. Recommend a detailed code review checklist to the review team.

Ans:

1. Does the code do what has been specified in the design specification? 

2. Does the procedure used in the module solve the problem correctly? 

3. Does a software module duplicate another existing module which could be reused? 

4. Are there computations using variables with inconsistent data types? Is overflow or underflow a possibility?

5. Are error codes and condition messages produced by accessing a common table of messages? Each error code should have a meaning, and all of the meanings should be available at one place in a table rather than scattered all over the program code. 

6. Is the code portable? The source code is likely to execute on multiple processor architectures and on different operating systems over its lifetime. It must be implemented in a manner that does not preclude this kind of a variety of execution environments. 

7. Is the code efficient? In general, clarity, readability, or correctness should not be sacrificed for efficiency. Code review is intended to detect implementation choices that have adverse effects on system performance.


5.)  In addition to code review, what other static unit testing techniques would you recommend for the project in exercise 3? Justify your answer. 

Ans: 

6.)  Describe the special role of a record keeper.

Ans: A job as a Record Keeper falls under the more extensive profession of File clerks. The data on this page will for the most part apply to all professions in this classification.

7.) Discuss the importance of code review rework and validation.

Ans: The Code review is a part of the procedure of improvement since the introduction of Software Engineering. It is vital on the grounds that it can alter botches ignored in the underlying advancement stage. It enhances both the general nature of programming and the designers' aptitudes. Code validation disposes issues so there is a superior shot of the site being seen by all on the internet as planned.
